#Alcohol Detection, Engine Blocking, and Automatic Braking System  

##üìå Overview  .md

This project is a smart vehicle safety system that combines alcohol detection, engine blocking, and automatic braking. It uses an MQ-3 alcohol sensor to detect intoxication and an ultrasonic sensor to sense vehicles or obstacles ahead. Based on the inputs, the system either blocks engine ignition or stops the vehicle using a braking mechanism.  .md

Built using Arduino, relay modules, motor simulation, and buzzers, the prototype demonstrates an effective prevention method against drunk driving and collisions.  .md

##‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle   

###‚úÖ 1. Alcohol Detection & Engine Blocking  

The MQ-3 sensor detects alcohol in the driver's breath.
If alcohol exceeds the threshold:
Engine/motor is turned OFF via relay
Buzzer/LED alerts the condition  

###‚úÖ 2. Automatic Braking Using Ultrasonic Sensor  

The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor continuously measures the distance ahead.
If an obstacle/vehicle is detected within a preset range:
The Arduino sends a signal to stop the motor (simulating braking)
An alarm or indicator can also be triggered
Both systems work independently and together for overall vehicle safety.
