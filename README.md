# üöó Alcohol Detection, Engine Blocking, and Automatic Braking System  

## üìå Overview  

This project is a **smart vehicle safety system** that combines alcohol detection, engine blocking, and automatic braking.  
It uses an **MQ-3 alcohol sensor** to detect intoxication and an **ultrasonic sensor** to sense vehicles or obstacles ahead.  
Based on the inputs, the system either blocks engine ignition or stops the vehicle using a braking mechanism.  

Built using **Arduino**, **relay modules**, **motor simulation**, and **buzzers**, the prototype demonstrates an effective prevention method against drunk driving and collisions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle  

### ‚úÖ 1. Alcohol Detection & Engine Blocking  

- The MQ-3 sensor detects alcohol in the driver's breath.  
- If alcohol exceeds the threshold:  
  - Engine/motor is turned **OFF** via relay  
  - **Buzzer/LED** alerts the condition  

### ‚úÖ 2. Automatic Braking Using Ultrasonic Sensor  

- The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor continuously measures the distance ahead.  
- If an obstacle/vehicle is detected within a preset range:  
  - The Arduino sends a signal to **stop the motor** (simulating braking)  
  - An **alarm or indicator** can also be triggered  

Both systems work independently and together for overall **vehicle safety**.
