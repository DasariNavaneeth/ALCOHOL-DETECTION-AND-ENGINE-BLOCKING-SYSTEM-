# ALCOHOL-DETECTION-AND-ENGINE-BLOCKING-SYSTEM-
A comprehensive vehicle safety system that uses an MQ-3 alcohol sensor to detect intoxication and automatically activates engine blocking and braking mechanisms. The project integrates Arduino-based control, relay modules, and motor actuation to prevent vehicle movement when alcohol levels exceed the safety threshold.
